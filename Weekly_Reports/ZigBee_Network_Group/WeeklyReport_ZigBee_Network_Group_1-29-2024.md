## ❖ Individual Report

### ❖ Love Patel

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Worked on the discovery Module and MOU along with the Group Contract signing.
- Researched about Zigbee and understanding how they work.

#### Key Points
- Worked on setting up Raspberry Pi with the onscreen and understanding the new setup.
- Successfully set up SSH and attempted to SSH into the Raspberry Pi through a personal laptop.

#### Next 2 Weeks Goals
- Get started on working on the setup for the Appliances System and map out the codebase.
- Communicate with other Zigbee members and collaborate to understand better how to connect all the Raspberry Pi to build an overall system.
- Learn and try to work with the Zigbee devices and attempt to mess around to understand how they work.
- Try to have some code to test on the Raspberry for the Appliances system.

### ❖ Deep Patel

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Set up VirtualBox and load the image.
- Get familiar with Golang and research HCI.
- Contribute to group contract and phase 1 document.

#### Key Points
- Engaged in the configuration of a Raspberry Pi, navigating through onscreen instructions to comprehend the setup.
- Accomplished the establishment of SSH and made an effort to remotely access the Raspberry Pi using macOS.

#### Next Week Goals
- Begin the setup process for the HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) part and outline the codebase structure.
- Collaborate with other members of the Zigbee group focusing on Xgbee communication with Raspberry Pi units to comprehend the integration for creating an overarching system.
- Dedicate time to learning and experimenting with Xgbee devices, aiming to gain insight into their functionalities.
- Work towards generating code for testing on the Raspberry Pi within the context of the HCI.

### ❖ Timothy Enders

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Familiarize with Golang.
- Utilize Oracle VM VirtualBox to emulate a Raspberry Pi virtual machine.
- Set up a Raspberry Pi environment with Go language and Git integration.
- Validate the functionality of a basic Go script on Raspberry Pi.
- Execute the signing of a group contract and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), while contributing to the development of a Discovery and Orientation Module document.

#### Key Points
- Learn the basics of connecting to Raspberry Pi via SSH.
- Follow the documentation to test the Xbee module using Python.
- Currently in the initial stages of learning how to establish a connection with a Zigbee device.

#### Next Week Goals
- Contemplate and initiate the development of a smart home lighting system on Raspberry Pi.
- Explore the fundamentals of connecting with Zigbee devices and writing code, collaborating with fellow team members.

### ❖ Joshua Murillo

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Familiarize myself with Golang/Goland.
- Experiment with the Raspberry Pi emulator.
- Familiarize myself with Zigbee products.
- Familiarize myself with the Go-Zigbee Package.
- Familiarize myself with our group contract and attach my digital signature.
- Contribute to the Discovery and Orientation Module document.

#### Key Points
- I was able to easily SSH into the Raspberry Pi assigned to me and added our assigned repository to its file contents.
- Utilised the given structures and functions supplied by Professor Oakes to simulate a possible structure for how the added appliances would be saved, checked, and serviced in the energy - main.go file.
- Currently, the added functions do not implement the Go-Zigbee package. This means that actually asking the Raspberry Pi to turn on an appliance would not work at the moment.

#### Next Week Goals
- Form a solid communication network with the rest of my team.
- Integrate the Go-Zigbee package into my current appliance state change functions to both receive and service requests from multiple device nodes.
- Implement Blockchain logging into each step of the appliance creation and modification process.

### ❖ Jahidul Robin

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Understand GoLang better.
- Began preliminary research on security systems compatible with Zigbee technology.

#### Key Points
- Conducted an extensive study on the latest Zigbee security devices and protocols to ensure our system's security and reliability. This included understanding how Zigbee's security features can be integrated with our mesh network to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Initiated the design phase for the security system by mapping out potential integration strategies for various security devices (e.g., smart locks, surveillance cameras). within the Zigbee network. This involved collaboration with the Mesh Home Zigbee Network Devices team to ensure compatibility and seamless communication between devices.
- Faced challenges in identifying security devices that would be most compatible with our envisioned network structure and the blockchain logging mechanism. Some devices showed limited compatibility with the Zigbee protocol, requiring additional research into workarounds or alternative solutions.

#### Next Week Goals
- Collaborate more closely with the Network Traffic Analysis System group to develop a monitoring system that alerts us to any unusual activity within the network, enhancing our security measures.
- Start implementing the blockchain logging mechanism for the security system to ensure that the history of security-related events is immutable and securely logged. This will involve understanding SHA256 encryption and how it can be applied to our use case.
- Plan for a small-scale test of the security system integration with the overall mesh.
