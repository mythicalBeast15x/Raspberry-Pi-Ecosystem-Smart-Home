## ❖ Team Report

### Previous Team Goals
- Collaborate with each other and other teams to complete the implementation of the messaging structure.
- Further test the Zigbee communication network.
- Look further into manipulating physical devices with our Raspberry Pis.

### Key Points
- Currently, the team is working towards blockchain data transfer using JSON AES encryption and utilize marshalling.

### Next Week Goals
- Have the AES integrated when sending data to the network and possibly blockchain.

## ❖ Individual Report

### ❖ Love Patel

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Complete JSON data transfer code.
- Enhance the encryption of the message communication with the security team
- Test the communication with multiple pi's
- Start creating Appliances function and send it over to the Data Layer Team
- Work with Backend and Data Layer to setup the communication workflow

#### Key Points


#### Next Week Goals


### ❖ Deep Patel

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Complete JSON data transfer code within Zigbee network.
- Enhance message/command security with network team.
- Plan phone connectivity via web app outside network.
- Test Raspberry Pi to Zigbee connection.
- Assist frontend team with bug testing and overcoming obstacles.

#### Key Points
- Testing JSON marshalled data on Pi's.
- The data is being marshalled and sent however its not unmarshalling the data.
- Started integrating AES and started testing and debugging.

#### Next Week Goals
- Have the AES working when data is sent to the network with the help of network team.
- Start integrating blockchain functions and test them.


### ❖ Timothy Enders

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Have discussions with the frontend/security members to review the implementation of the TLS web certificate and advance it.
- Assist in finalizing the communication structure of the ZigBee network.
- Initiate physical testing of ZigBee devices, along with documenting and capturing visual interactions of the ZigBee devices.
- Collaborate with other teams to define lighting functions for different areas.

#### Key Points
- The integration of the web certificate requires further adjustment, as warnings persist indicating an insecure connection in the browser. Even the manual addition of the certificate to the Chrome browser did not resolve the issue. To my understanding, the setup was correct, but for a self-signed certificate, it needs to be configured to validate its use relying on a certificate authority.
- Implemented a template function in the startup Go file for it to check the presence of a device on the ZigBee network. This function makes repeated attempts to communicate with a ZigBee device within a specified number of tries.

#### Next Week Goals
- Determine how to adapt lighting functions to fit within the backend/frontend structure.
- Support the communication and interaction of ZigBee devices with the backend.
- Implementate blockchain functions and conduct testing.
- Collaborate with other teams to finalize the core logic of the project.
- Upon completion of the foundational structure, commence physical testing of ZigBee devices while concurrently documenting and capturing visual interactions of these devices.
- Aid in the development of startup functions.
- Complete the setup of the web certificate.

### ❖ Joshua Murillo

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Discuss the messaging structure with other groups and use these discussions to completely implement the messaging structure into our system.
- Retrieve the Zigbee device that was relinquished to other members of the Zigbee team and discuss the status of the Zigbee network with them.
- Work with and implement code to manipulate physical devices with our Raspberry Pis.
- Discuss with Love Patel about the relationship between the Appliances and the energy system and reworking the energy file to house functions relevant to energy management.
- Create tests for the various messaging structure functions.

#### Key Points

#### Next Week Goals

### ❖ Jahidul Robin

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Work with front-end and back-end group to finish setting up authentication and tokens.
- Work on the encryption of the message communication.
- Pick up any tasks that needs to be finished.
- Help any group that needs it.

#### Key Points

#### Next Week Goals

### ❖ Mitkumar Patel

#### Previous Individual Goals/Objectives
- Hopefully we have the motion sensors so i am able to setup a presence detection temperature setting feature.
- Advance the scheduling feature of the HVAC system to ensure the use has detailed options to set the schedule.
- Assist with the frontend of the UI
