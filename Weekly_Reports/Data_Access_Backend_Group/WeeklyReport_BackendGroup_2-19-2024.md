# Weekly Report 2/19/2024
Follow this template exactly for every report including the name of the document. Use this to help delegate tasks to each member. Every time has one weekly report. There should be one team section and multiple individual sections for each person.
Format this well, copy and paste this all and remove all the boilerplate stuff. Make it look professional and nice. This is separate from the documentation you may be keeping in the Microsoft Teams. Although, you can talk about that in this. These are due every Monday unless stated otherwise. They will be placed within your team's respective folder.

## Team Report

- Discuss and review JSON
- Discuss with the Zigbee group to ensure we are anticipating their needs in the current setup

### Key Points
- Code review and bug testing
- Research on user login token
- Mapping out DAL and trying to determine the actual needs of other groups 
  
### Next Week's Goals
- Schedule a meeting with the Network Analysis team.
- Schedule a meeting with the Zigbee team.
- Build prototype for user login token system.

## Individual Report
This is for each person and what you have focused on. Make these all bullet points.

### Previous Team Goals
- Include things like what you worked on last week.
  
### Key Points
- What you worked on this week?

- Research on HMAC.
- Come to an agreement on the consensus algorithm that is going to be implemented.
- Implement the P2P aspect of blockchain.

### Key Points
- Didn't get the chance to meat with other groups. 
- Research is done on HMAC, Encryption, Decryption, and how to implement a user login token system. 
- Code review and bug testing for the existing codes. 
- Replaced the testing stubs for encryption and decryption.

### Next Week's Goals

## Individual Report - Cat Monteith 
### Previous Goals 
- Discuss with other groups 
- Review JSON 
- Study HMAC

### Key Points
- Shifted Gears in order to better fit the needs of our current sprint.
- Discussed with member of Zigbee team to assess current Zigbee process and potentially anticipated needs
  will need to group properly, but I've been studying the existing functions and have a better idea about how DAL should be 
- Drafted some BRIEF Pseudocode for the purpose of visually showing other groups our current line of thinking
- Main Difficulty: ascertaining what code is appropriate based on existing systems
- Failed to meet with Front End team

### Next Week's Goals 
- Refine & Properly create base model of DAL (beyond Pseudo)
- Meet with Front End team to better shape DAL to fit their needs and figure out how to communicate to some of 
the existing functions 
- Touch Base again with Zigbee to see if I can gain anymore insight

## Individual Report - David Weisman
### Previous Goals 
- Gain better understanding of the progress of the other groups, so we can work better together.
- Become more familiar with HMAC and how we can utilize this in our blockchain.
- Get on the same page as a team with the consensus algorithm.

### Key Points
- Met with the Front End to get better understanding of their needs
- Worked on a team deliverable document
- Researched into other applications of user login token systems

### Next Week's Goals 
- Continue collaboration with frontend as they add more functionalities
- Work on things more often as opposed to doing all the work on one day
