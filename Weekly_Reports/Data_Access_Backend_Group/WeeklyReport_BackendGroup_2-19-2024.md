# Weekly Report 2/19/2024
Follow this template exactly for every report including the name of the document. Use this to help delegate tasks to each member. Every time has one weekly report. There should be one team section and multiple individual sections for each person.
Format this well, copy and paste this all and remove all the boilerplate stuff. Make it look professional and nice. This is separate from the documentation you may be keeping in the Microsoft Teams. Although, you can talk about that in this. These are due every Monday unless stated otherwise. They will be placed within your team's respective folder.
