# Weekly Report 2/5/2024
## Team Report
### Previous Team Goals
- Set up Raspberry Pi
- Gain better understanding of GoLang
- Gain better understanding of Blockchain

### Key Points
- Optimized the blockchain for this project

### Next Week Team Goals
- Block validation

## Individual Report - Caitlin Crowe
### Previous Goals
- Set up Raspberry Pi with 64-bit OS
- Attempted to get MongoDB running on Raspberry Pi (unsuccessful)

### Key Points
- Created and integrated a stub encryption function for the crypto team to implement later.
- Implemented difficulty level for hashing function in the blockchain.
- Created block verification function.
- Some code may need refactoring as I don't fully understand the GoLang syntax yet.

### Next Week's Goals
- Continue testing and implementing core blockchain functionality.
- Create a simple way for other teams to log actions with the blockchain.

## Individual Report - Xingyu Jiang
### Previous Goals
- Getting familiar with Golang.
- Get Raspberry pi working on virtualbox.
- Setup GitHub and go on virtual Raspberry.
### Key Points
- Understand what blockchain is and how we can implement it.
- Implement a simple blockchain program that keeps track of activities
- Attempt to Implement a simple consensus algorithms
- Wasn't able to find a proper consensus algorithm that best fits the situation weâ€™re having

### Next Week's Goals
- Get a prototype of the consensus algorithm.

## Individual Report - David Weisman
### Previous Goals
- Work and practice Golang
- Familiarize myself with repository
- Learn more about blockchain

### Key Points
- Practiced with Golang via small projects and examples
- Gained better understanding of Blockchain
- Adapted some functionality for our specific blockchain adaptation
  
### Next Week's Goals
- Set up better communication as a team
- Add more testing for the blockchain

## Individual Report - Catherine Monteith
### Previous Goals
- Get familiar with Blockchain
- Get Familiar with Go

### Key Points
- Reviewed Code made by Cait (Refer to above)
- Attempted to Make small adjustments to functions, hopefully making them a little more modular
    - specifically, attempted to divide hashing and consensus algorithm (basic Proof of Work setup) into two
    - One of my adjustments is failing testing, need more time to determine why
### Next Week's Goals
- Understand Consensus Algorithms
- Research and Gain better understanding of how Zigbee group/devices will interact with the blockchain
- Gain understanding of how blockchain is agreed upon by multiple nodes beyond
