# Weekly Report 2/5/2024
*(Note from Cait: I wrote my own individual report, but the team report section still needs to be written.)*

Follow this template exactly for every report including the name of the document. Use this to help delegate tasks to each member. Everytime has one weekly report. There should be 1 team section and multiple individual sections for each person.
Format this well, just copy and paste this all and remove all the boiler plate stuff. Make it look professional and nice. This is seperate from the documentation you may be keeping in the Microsoft Teams. Although, you can talk about that in this. These are due every Monday unless stated otherwise. They will be placed within your team's respective folder.

## Team Report
This is the entire team and what you have worked on. Make these all bullet points.

### Previous Team Goals
- Set up Raspberry Pi
- Gain better understanding of GoLang
- Gain better understanding of Blockchain

### Key Points
- Optimized the blockchain for this project
- 

### Next Week Team Goals
- Team next week goals that you plan to focus on or learn about. These are 2 week sprints, so keep that in mind.

## Individual Report - Caitlin Crowe
### Previous Goals
- Set up Raspberry Pi with 64-bit OS
- Attempted to get MongoDB running on Raspberry Pi (unsuccessful)

### Key Points
- Created and integrated a dummy encryption function for the crypto team to implement later.
- Implemented difficulty level for hashing function in the blockchain.
- Created a block verification function.
- Some code may need refactoring as I don't fully understand the GoLang syntax yet.

### Next Week Goals
- Continue testing and implementing core blockchain functionality.
- Create a simple way for other teams to log actions with the blockchain.

## Individual Report - Xingyu Jiang
### Previous Goals
- Getting familiar with Golang.
- Get Raspberry pi working on virtualbox.
- Setup GitHub and go on virtual Raspberry.
### Key Points
- Understand what blockchain is and how we can implement it.
- Implement a simple blockchain program that keep track of activities
- Attempt to Implement a simple consensus algorithms
- Wasn't able to find a proper consensus algorithm that best fit the situation weâ€™re having

### Next Week Goals
- Get a prototype of the consensus algorithm.

## Individual Report - David Weisman
### Previous Goals
- Work and practice Golang
- Familarize myself with repository
- Learn more about blockchain

### Key Points
- Practiced with Golang via small projects and examples
- Gained better understanding of Blockchain
- Adapted some functionality for our specific blockchain adaptation
  
### Next Week Goals
- Set up better communication as a team
- Add more testing for the blockchain

## Individual Report - Catherine Monteith
### Previous Goals
- Get familiar with Blockchain
- Get Familiar with Go

### Key Points
- Reviewed Code made by Cait (Refer to above)
- Attempted to Make small adjustments to functions, hopefully making them a little more modular
    - specifically attempted to divide hashing and consensus algorithm (basic Proof of Work setup) into two
    - One of my adjustments is failing testing, need more time to determine why
### Next Week Goals
- Understand Consensus Algorithms
- Research and Gain better understanding of how Zigbee group/devices will interact with the blockchain
- Gain understanding of how blockchain is agreed upon by multiple nodes beyond
