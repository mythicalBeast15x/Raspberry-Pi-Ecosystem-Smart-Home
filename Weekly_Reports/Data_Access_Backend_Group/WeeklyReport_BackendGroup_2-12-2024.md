# Weekly Report 1/29/2024
Follow this template exactly for every report including the name of the document. Use this to help delegate tasks to each member. Everytime has one weekly report. There should be 1 team section and multiple individual sections for each person.
Format this well, just copy and paste this all and remove all the boiler plate stuff. Make it look professional and nice. This is seperate from the documentation you may be keeping in the Microsoft Teams. Although, you can talk about that in this. These are due every Monday unless stated otherwise. They will be placed within your team's respective folder.

## Team Report
This is the entire team and what you have worked on. Make these all bullet points.

## Team Report
This is the entire team and what you have worked on. Make these all bullet points.

### Previous Team Goals
- Setting up blockchain Framework
- Setting up & Testing various verification methods

### Key Points
- A basic blockchain framework is set up & has anticipatory functions for encryption and decryption
- Basic Verification functions & hashing functionality
- Functions for JSON Serialization and Deserialization
-

### Next Week Team Goals
- Discuss with Network Analysis team to either begin implementation or modify existing functions for encryption/decryption to prepare for integration
- Discuss and review JSON
- Discuss with Zigbee group to ensure we are anticipating their needs in current setup

## Individual Report
This is for each person and what you have focused on. Make these all bullet points.

### Previous Team Goals
- Include things like what you worked on last week.

### Key Points
- What you worked on this week.
- What did work.
- What did not work if there were any.
- Anything important.

### Next Week Goals
- Next week goals thaty you plan to focus on or learn about. These are 2 week sprints, so keep that in mind.

## Individual Report - Catherine Monteith
### Previous Goals
- Understand Consensus Algorithms
- Research and Gain better understanding of how Zigbee group/devices will interact with the blockchain
- Gain understanding of how blockchain is agreed upon by multiple nodes beyond

### Key Points
- Currently Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm has a basic implementation, but this algorithm might need adjustment
- Added function & Tests to check that every block on a chain is verified. 
  - From my research I have found that some systems do this and check at certain intervals to see if an entire blockchain is valid. 
  - If the Consensus algorithm used is Proof of Work, nodes will often agree upon the longest valid chain 
  - This function is essentially a basis for the above in anticipation of such an issue but might need to be modified 
  as the project moves forward.

### Next Week Goals
- Discuss with other groups to ensure blockchain framework is correctly anticipating their needs. 
- Review JSON implementation 
- Look into HMAC to understand how this can help prevent tampered blocks & figure out how and where blockchain framework might need to support this.
