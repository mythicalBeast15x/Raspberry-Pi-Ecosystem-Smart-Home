## Team Report

### Previous Team Goals
- Prioritize the development and testing of code for Raspberry Pi.
- Establish communication pathways for Zigbee devices to interact with Raspberry Pi.
- Test and research various encryption and hashing techniques.


### Key Points
- Initial steps were taken towards learning and understanding Zigbee technology and its integration with Raspberry Pi.

### Next Week Goals
- Testing any flaws that can happen in the network security side throughout this sprint (this week and next week)
- Creating a structure to hold Zigbee Device information
- Working alongside Zigbee Team to understand how the XBEE Communicates and see what can be improved from a security stand point

## Individual Report

### Darsh

#### Previous Team Goals


#### Key Points

#### Next Week Goals


### Karen

#### Previous Team Goals
- Created test cases for AES and Network
- Pushed code for AES encryption 
- Network code (told to hold off in) will edit it a bit more - security 

#### Key Points
- Test for any flaws throughout the network, and think about more that can rise further along
- Document the flaws and more that can possibly arise
- Research how to later ensure that only messages from known devices are accepted


#### Next Week Goals
- Create many test cases that show what happens when many blocks are created and mined
- Create a Test Suite that tests the time duration of adding blocks to the block chain (the speed)
- Add more comments onto our codes so its easily understandable to other groups
- Begin working on the deliverable that is due at the end of the month
