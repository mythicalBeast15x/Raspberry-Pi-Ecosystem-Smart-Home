# Weekly Report 02/26/2024


## Team Report

### Previous Team Goals
- Testing any flaws that can happen in the network security side throughout this sprint (this week and next week)
- Creating a structure to hold Zigbee Device information
- Working alongside Zigbee Team to understand how the XBEE Communicates and see what can be improved from a security stand point


### Key Points
- Tested the files (client and controller) for sending and receiving signals between the Zigbees.
- Implemented AES encryption for data encryption between the IOT devices.


#### Next Week Goals
- Test for any flaws throughout the network, and think about more that can rise further along, along with documenting
- Setup and Complete AES Encryption
- Implement HMAC in the areas it is needed
- Bug testing communication



## Individual Report

### Darsh

#### Previous Team Goals
- Worked with the Zigbee team to figure out if the Zigbees are communicating.
- Tested the files (client and controller) for sending and receiving signals between the Zigbees.
- Implemented AES encryption for data encryption between the IOT devices.

#### Key Points
- Setup basic HMAC functions.
- Made some changes to the AES encryption by adding generatekey() function.
- Understanding how AES and HMAC work together when sending and receiving the messages.

#### Next Week Goals
- Have the serialized JSON data to encrypt.
- Use the encrypted ciphertext to generate HMAC.
- After HMAC verifies the hash it will decrypt the data into raw JSON format.



### Karen

#### Previous Team Goals
- Create many test cases that show what happens when many blocks are created and mined
- Create a Test Suite that tests the time duration of adding blocks to the block chain (the speed)
- Begin working on the deliverable that is due at the end of the month


#### Key Points
- Finished the diagram for the deliverable due at the end of the month
- Almost done the block chain test cases
- Began HMAC implementation 


#### Next Week Goals
- Finish the created test cases/suite that tests the time duration of adding blocks to block chain
- Need to check if the HMAC implementation I began is correct
- Add more comments onto our codes so its easily understandable to other groups
