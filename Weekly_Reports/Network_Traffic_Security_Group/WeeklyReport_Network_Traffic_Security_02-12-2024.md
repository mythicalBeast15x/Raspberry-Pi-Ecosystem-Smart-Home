# Weekly Report 02/12/2024


## Team Report

### Previous Team Goals
- Achieve the signing of group contract and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
- Advance progress on the Discovery and Orientation Module document, including contributions from all team members.
- Discussing the development and testing code for Raspberry Pi. 


### Key Points

- Prioritized the code and development for Raspberry Pi
- Tested hashing techniques.
- Researched some encryption and hashing techniques

### Next Week Goals
- Prioritize the development and testing of code in Raspberry Pi once they are setup.
- Establish communication pathways for Zigbee devices to interact with Raspberry Pi.
- Cross communicate with other teams to know requirements and see the progress

## Individual Report

### Darsh

#### Previous Team Goals
- Research various hashing and encryption techniques
- Find ways to have zigbees talk to each other
- Start testing code.

#### Key Points
- Researched and tested hashing algorithms
- Did some analysis on the MD5, SHA1, SHA2(256 & 512)
- Tested AES for encryption so that secure data is transmitted between devices

#### Next Week Goals
- Testing on the physical devices if pi's communicate.
- Have the zigbees communicate with each other.
- Enhance the give AES encryption and decryption implementation.

### Karen

#### Previous Team Goals
- Researched about the tasks given in our class meeting / created a doc for our team to have some ideas to begin with for the research
- Began creating test cases (also attached in teams for our team to collaborate and share comments on)
- Pushed code for AES encryption  

#### Key Points
- Test and Research Various Encryption and Hashing Techniques
- Research how Zigbee Devices talk to each other
- Began coding a bit but would like to dicsuss on monday or tuesday with my team member before anything is pushed
- Began a code for AES encryption, still may need some some changes.  

#### Next Week Goals
- Encryption
- Testing
- Pushing code
- Getting along with the Network group and see the progress so we are able to collab
