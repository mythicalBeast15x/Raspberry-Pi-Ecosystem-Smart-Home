## About the Project
This projected is being developed by the graduating Computer Science Majors at Penn State Abington. The project aims to demonstrate the knowledge acquired throughout the course of each student's educational journey. Team collaboration is
heavily emphasized through all development stages of the application.
**More will be added**

## Thursday Team Starting Groups

### Important Note
These groups are changeable and may change depending on where work is needed. Some groups might have less work in the beginning (other than research) so people might be shuffled around. The mesh home ZigBee network is itself one whole group, where each person will focus on a portion of each system. All groups will have to communicate effectively with each other, and some groups might work with other groups often. Outside meetings will be needed to meet the goals of the project. There are some things that every group will need to focus on, like block chain logging. Also, please understand these are brief descriptions of everything discussed and things may change throughout the project. No person will be dead set in one area. This means within your group, you need to focus your efforts on wherever it is needed at that time. Everyone must thoroughly research all areas of the project. Understanding the big picture is essential. 

#### Mesh Home Zigbee Network Devices 
This group is treated as one team where each person focuses on a certain device or the energy of those devices. Collaborate accordingly as many devices may interface similarly. Of course, some devices may require more work than others, so this means you may have to help each other out. 
- Lighting System: Timothy Enders 
- Security System: Jahidul Robin 
- HVAC System: Mitkumar Patel 
- Appliances System: Love Patel 
- Energy System: Joshua Murillo 
- HCI System: Deep Patel 

#### Network Traffic Analysis System 
This group will work closely with the ZigBee Network device group to ensure the network is working correctly and receiving alerts when things change. The user will be able to see what is happening within the network. This group is close to a subgroup of the ZigBee Network device group. 
- Network Traffic Analysis: Harkaran Kaur 
- Network Traffic Analysis: Darshit Patel 

#### Data Access Layer and Backend PC Group 
This group allows everything to connect together. They will be responsible for the database, as well as any other API type functionality that will be needed. The data access layer will expose any needed information to the users of the application. 
- Data Access Layer and Backend PC: David Weisman 
- Data Access Layer and Backend PC: Xingyu Jiang 
- Data Access Layer and Backend PC: Catherine Monteith 
- Data Access Layer and Backend PC: Caitlin Crowe 

#### User Web Frontend and Middleware PC Group 
This group will be responsible for the website portion of the project. This is what the user will see when accessing the website. They will also be responsible for correctly interacting with any API type functionality that is created to retrieve information. 
- User Web Frontend and Middleware PC Group: Joshua Delva 
- User Web Frontend and Middleware PC Group: Elizabeth Johney 

#### Project Manager 
Coordinate project and provide help wherever it may be needed. Main communication to professor and resources that may be needed. Answer questions to the best of their ability.  
- Project Manager: Tyler Thompson 

#### Leader Roles 
These roles include working with the project manager to ensure everything is flowing together. These leader roles are on top of the other roles they are assigned and just provide another means of communication for specialized portions of the project. Will meet with project manager to ensure everyone is on same page. 

##### Team Lead 
This role includes researching all technical portions of the project and ensuring that all groups are functioning according to plan. Works closely with project manager to do code reviews and define scope. Has meetings with project manager often. May have to help in all areas of project. 
- Team Lead: Love-Divine Onwulata 

##### Hardware and ZigBee Specialist 
This role includes trying to answer any questions and do some research in the ZigBee portion of the project. These questions may come from any of the groups involved with working with ZigBee directly. May also look into Raspberry Pi questions if needed. 
- Hardware and ZigBee Specialist: Timothy Enders
## Suggestions
Please direct any suggestions to the project manager or team lead. If you wish to support this project in any way, please contact the project manager.
